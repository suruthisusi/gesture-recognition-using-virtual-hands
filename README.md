The "Gesture Recognition Using Virtual Hands" project introduces an innovative approach to ATM
interactions by leveraging advanced technologies such as facial recognition and hand gesture recognition.
The primary goal is to create a secure, user-friendly, and touchless ATM experience, reducing the reliance
on physical touchpoints and enhancing overall convenience for users. The system begins with a robust
facial recognition process using the Haar Cascade algorithm, ensuring the accurate identification of users
based on their facial features. Once the face matching is successfully completed, the system matches with
a unique user ID for authentication. To further enhance security, users are prompted to enter a password.
Hand gesture recognition, powered by the Mediapipe library, plays a pivotal role in enabling touchless
navigation within the ATM interface. Users can interact with the system, select debit transactions or
balance inquiries, and navigate through the ATM menu using hand gestures. This intuitive gesture-based
interaction eliminates the need for physical contact with the ATM interface, providing a seamless and
secure user experience. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the ATM is designed with user-friendliness
in mind, presenting users with clear menu options for their transactions. The integration of these
cutting-edge technologies not only ensures a high level of security but also positions the project at the
forefront of modern ATM design.
